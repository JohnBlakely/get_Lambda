# Note for Serial Code #

Ignore the get_Lambda file it's broken, everything is in the RecfastJulia2 folder. The goal of the code is to get the cooling at fixed temperature and density after the age of the universe. Sorry it's a mess! The issue, optimization wise is in the react file, because of this I have the contribution from chemical cooling commented out.
